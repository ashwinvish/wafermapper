StitchEM
========

The purpose of this project is to create a robust and effective solution to the problem of stitching and alignment of large serial electron microscopy datasets.

At the time of this writing, it is not nearly finished and poorly documented.

See stitchSection.m and stitchWafer.m for fully working examples.

The pipeline roughly looks like this:

Metadata processing -> Feature extraction -> Feature matching -> Transformation optimization -> Rendering

This file will (hopefully) be much more helpful in time.
